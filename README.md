# Near-Real-time-Job-Fraud-Detection using Apache Spark, Spark Streaming, Spark MLlib, and PySpark:

- Devised a scrapping code with help of Python, using BeautifulSoup and selenium to scrape job postings
- Implemented Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature extraction using PySpark along with packages such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and TfidfVectorizer
- Built a prediction model leveraging Gradient Boosting Classifier (Spark's MLlib), performed evaluation using metrics such as precision, recall, and AUC, and computed predictions for scrapped jobs
- Obtained an overall accuracy rate of 94%, with precision and recall rates of 94% and 98% respectively.
